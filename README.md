## NHS Staffing and Resource Utilization Analysis for Network Operations

# Background/context of the business scenario:

Our team is conducting research to identify trends that can help reduce avoidable costs of missed general practitioner appointments in the England National Health Services (NHS). 
To ensure data-driven solutions, we are analyzing historical data about all appointments at general practitioner (GP) surgeries across the country, gathered from the integrated care board (ICB), a statutory NHS organization responsible for healthcare and budget management in specific regions of England. Currently, we are focusing on two key questions posed by the NHS: whether there is enough staff and capacity in the networks, and what the actual utilization of resources looks like.
