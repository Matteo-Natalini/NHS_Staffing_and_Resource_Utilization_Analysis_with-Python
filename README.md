## IMPORT AND EXPLORE THE DATA
After importing the 3 datasets the data has been sense checked and no errors or empty cells are in the files.
The national_categories dataset is the largest and is the one I used to perform the first exploration. 
There are 106 locations in the dataset, 5 service settings, 3 context types, 18 different national categories and 3 appointment statuses (from the appointments_regional dataset).
I found the top 5 locations per number of records which are: North West London, Kent and Medway, Devon, Hampshire and Isle Of Wight, North East London.
