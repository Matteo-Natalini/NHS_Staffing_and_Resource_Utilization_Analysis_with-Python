## IMPORT AND EXPLORE THE DATA
After importing the 3 datasets the data has been sense checked and no errors or empty cells are in the files.
The national_categories dataset is the largest and is the one I used to perform the first exploration. 
There are 106 locations in the dataset, 5 service settings, 3 context types, 18 different national categories and 3 appointment statuses (from the appointments_regional dataset).
I found the top 5 locations per number of records which are: 
1. North West London, 
2. Kent and Medway, 
3. Devon, 
4. Hampshire and Isle Of Wight, 
5. North East London.

## ANALYSE THE DATA
The data types of the date columns have been uniformated and changed in a datetime format.
With the min() and max() formulas it has been possible to identify the oldest and most recent appointments in the data frames.
The data goes from August 2021 to June 2022 and NC dataset is the one that holds the most data.
The most we the most appointments was November 2021 with 30,405.070 appointments.
